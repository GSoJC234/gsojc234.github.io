# About 
Hello, I am a Ph.D candidate in Software Verification Laboratory at POSTECH, 
under the suprevision of Kyungmin Bae. 
My research interests include model checking and model-based testing for 
distributed systems and network protocols.

<br/>

# Research Interests
* Model checking to develop safe, reliable, and secure distributed systems.
* Formal specification and model-based testing of TLS protocols using rewrite theory. 

<br/>
